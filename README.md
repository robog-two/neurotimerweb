# NeuroTimer Storybook

This is a quick little project where I have created several of the components for NeuroTimer in a Storybook. A Storybook is basically a little playground for viewing and testing different individual components.

## To start

Install yarn if you haven't already using [these instructions](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install).

Then, run this in your terminal:

```sh
yarn; yarn storybook
```

Once it finishes compiling, it should open your browser where you can look at all the components!
